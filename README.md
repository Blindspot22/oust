# ORUST

This repository contains the source code for the Writing an OS in Rust series at <a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/">os.phil-opp.com</a> by Philipp Oppermann.

This is my version of Philipp Oppermann's "BlogOS".
 It's a baremetal operating system that can boot off of a USB stick on any BIOS-compatible machine, which is pretty amazing. I'm going to be running the OS using QEMU instead of booting a physical machine. Just to keep things simple. If you have questions, open an issue.

## Where is the code?

The code for each post lives in a separate git branch. This makes it possible to see the intermediate state after each post.


The code for the latest post is available <a href="https://github.com/Blindspot22/orust/">here.</a>.

You can find the branch for each post by following the (source code) link in the <a href="https://github.com/Blindspot22/orust?tab=readme-ov-file#posts">Post list</a> below. The branches are named post-XX where XX is the post number, for example post-03 for the VGA Text Mode post or post-07 for the Hardware Interrupts post. For build instructions, see the Readme of the respective branch.
